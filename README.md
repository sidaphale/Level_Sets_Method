# Level_Sets_Method
Implementation of Level Sets Methods to study reinitialization and sub-cell fix

Used the PDE based reinitialization scheme and created a program to reinitialize the input level set function
The domain for the function is [-2,2] X [-2,2] with a 64x64 grid
1st order for both time and upwind discretization, time step of 0.5h

Instructions to build:

C++ code
Compile the "levelset.cpp" and execute

Matlab code
Open "level_set.m" in Matlab and run
